Approach:

- We started this lab by implementing the context free grammer given in the lab spec.
- For each production rule, we called yTRACE
- We next resolved presedence by adding associativity and precedence rules to the bison declarations
- We tested our lab by creating small positive and negative testcases for the common production rules
- We tested precedence by seeing the order in which expressions were being evaluated and whether this matches up to precedence rules

Problems we had:
- Understanding how to read the final output
- Fixing the precedence for UMINUS rule by giving it the precedence of UMINUS using %prec
-
